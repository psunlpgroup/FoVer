,,question,"Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?"
,,y_true,48
,,solution selected by baseline
,,step 0,Dave ate 14 french fries before the seagull took the pack.,1.0,1.0
,,step 1,"The seagull ate half the amount that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.",1.0,0.96875
,,step 2,"After the seagull, the total eaten so far is 14 + 7 = 21 french fries.",1.0,0.9921875
,,step 3,"Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, which is 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.",1.0,1.0
,,step 4,"So, the total eaten by this point is 21 + 9 = 30 french fries.",1.0,0.99609375
,,step 5,A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. This means one-third of the fries were left.,0.6796875,0.70703125
,,step 6,"Let the total number of fries initially be \( x \). After the seagull and pigeons ate, \( x - 30 \) fries were left.",1.0,0.9765625
,,step 7,"The raccoon stole two-thirds of these, leaving one-third: \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).",1.0,0.98828125
,,step 8,"The ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 behind, which means before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.",1.0,0.9140625
,,step 9,"So, \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \).",1.0,0.93359375
,,step 10,"Multiplying both sides by 3, we get \( x - 30 = 18 \).",1.0,0.98828125

,,question,"There is one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, how old is one of the twins?"

,,solution selected by baseline
,,step 0,Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \).,1.0,0.81640625
,,step 1,"Then, the age of the older twin is \( x + 7 \).",1.0,0.94140625

,,step 3,The total combined ages are given as 44:,1.0,0.98828125

,,step 11,Divide both sides by 5:,1.0,1.0
,,step 12,\[ x = 6 \],1.0,0.99609375
