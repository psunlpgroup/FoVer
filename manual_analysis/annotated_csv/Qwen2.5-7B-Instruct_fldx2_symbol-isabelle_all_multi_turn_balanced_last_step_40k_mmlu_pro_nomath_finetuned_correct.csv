,,question,"A very slow-moving positron interacts with a stationary electron. Which of the following statements correctly describes a possible outcome of this reaction and why it would occur?
(A) Conservation of momentum suggests that the reaction could result in three identical gamma rays moving in different directions.
(B) Conservation of mass indicates that if a single new particle were created in the reaction, it must have a total mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron.
(C) Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created.
(D) Conservation of mass indicates that the reaction could not occur as the masses of the electron and positron are too different.
(E) Conservation of energy indicates that the reaction would result in the positron gaining momentum and the electron remaining stationary.
(F) Conservation of charge indicates that the reaction would create a new particle with a positive charge.
(G) Conservation of mass indicates that the reaction would result in the creation of a new particle with a mass larger than the combined masses of the electron and positron.
(H) Conservation of charge indicates that all new particles created in the reaction would have no electric charge.
(I) Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.
(J) Conservation of energy indicates that the reaction would result in the creation of a single gamma ray."

,,step 1,"- **Conservation of momentum**: The total momentum before the interaction must equal the total momentum after the interaction. Since the electron is initially stationary, the momentum of the positron must be conserved. If two identical gamma rays were created, they would need to move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. However, this would require the total energy of the gamma rays to equal the rest mass energy of the electron and positron, which is not the case in this scenario.",0.70703125,0.349609375
,,step 2,"- **Conservation of energy**: The total energy before the interaction (rest mass energy of the electron and positron) must equal the total energy after the interaction. The annihilation of a positron and an electron results in the conversion of their rest mass energy into gamma rays. The energy of the gamma rays would be \(2m_e c^2\), where \(m_e\) is the mass of the electron (or positron) and \(c\) is the speed of light.",1.0,0.8359375
,,step 3,"- **Conservation of charge**: The total charge before the interaction must equal the total charge after the interaction. Since the electron and positron have opposite charges, they will annihilate each other, resulting in no net charge.",1.0,0.98046875

Therefore, two gamma rays moving in opposite directions would result in zero net momentum, which satisfies this conservation law.",1.0,0.8515625
