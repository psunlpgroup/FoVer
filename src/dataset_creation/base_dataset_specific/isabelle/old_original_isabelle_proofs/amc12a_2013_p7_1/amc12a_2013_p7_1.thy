theorem yourtask:
  fixes s :: "nat \<Rightarrow> real"
  assumes h0 : "\<And>n. s (n+3) = s (n+2) + 2 * s (n+1) + s n"
    and h1 : "s 6 = 50"
    and h2 : "s 4 = 18"
  shows "s 2 = 5"
proof -
  have p1 : "s 6 = s 5 + 2 * s 4 + s 3" using h0[of 3] by auto
  have p2 : "s 5 = s 6 - 2 * s 4 - s 3" using p1 by auto
  have p3 : "s 5 = 50 - 2 * 18 - s 3" using p2 h1 h2 by auto
  have p4 : "s 5 = 50 - 36 - s 3" using p3 by auto
  have p5 : "s 5 = 14 - s 3" using p4 by auto
  have p6 : "s 3 = s 4 + 2 * s 2 + s 1" using h0[of 1] by auto
  have p7 : "s 2 = s 3 - 2 * s 1 - s 0" using p6 by auto
  have p8 : "s 4 = s 5 + 2 * s 2 + s 1" using h0[of 1] by auto
  have p9 : "s 1 = s 4 - 2 * s 2 - s 0" using p8 by auto
  have p10 : "s 2 = s 5 - 2 * s 1 - s 0 + s 0" using p7 by auto
  have p11 : "s 2 = (14 - s 3) - 2 * (s 4 - 2 * s 2 - s 0) - s 0" using p10 p5 by auto
  have p12 : "s 2 = 14 - s 3 - 2 * s 4 + 4 * s 2 + s 0 - s 0
