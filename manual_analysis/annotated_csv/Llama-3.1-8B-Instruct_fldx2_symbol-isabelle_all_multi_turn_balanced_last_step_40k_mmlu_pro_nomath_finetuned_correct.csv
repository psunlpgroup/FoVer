,,step 0,"The moral argument against imprisoning A in the case of debtors is based on the principle of retributive justice, which is a concept in ethics that argues that punishment should be proportional to the crime committed.

,,question,"How does Buzan's concept of 'societal security' mark a departure from traditional understandings of security?
(A) Securing the sustainable development of the state was dependent on societal security as an independent interest that was not secondary or dependent on the other sectors, including the military.
(B) The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security. Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.
(C) Societal security referred to the sustainable development of traditional patterns of military capabilities. Military threats could be subdivided to include the infrastructural strength, the technology, personnel, the economic base and the political base of the military security sector.
(D) Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object.
